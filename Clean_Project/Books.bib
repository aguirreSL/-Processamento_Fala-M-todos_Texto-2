  author = {Jens Blauert},
  pages = {379},
  abstract = {Communication Acoustics deals with the fundamentals of those areas
	of acoustics which are related to modern communication technologies.
	Due to the advent of digital signal processing and recording in acoustics,
	these areas have enjoyed an enormous upswing during the last 4 decades.
	The book chapters represent review articles covering the most relevant
	areas of the field. They are written with the goal of providing students
	with comprehensive introductions. Further they offer a supply of
	numerous references to the relevant literature. Besides its usefulness
	as a textbook, this will make the book a source of valuable information
	for those who want to improve or refresh their knowledge in the field
	of communication acoustics - and to work their way deeper into it.
	Due to its interdisciplinary character Communication Acoustics is
	bound to attract readers from many different areas, such as: acoustics,
	cognitive science, speech science, and communication technology.},

	Carefully selected examples illustrate the application of acoustic
	principles and problems are provided for training.'Acoustics for
	Engineers' is designed for extensive teaching at the university level.
	Under the guidance of an academic teacher it is sufficient as the
	sole textbook for the subject. Each chapter deals with a well defined
	topic and represents the material for a two-hour lecture. The 15
	chapters alternate between more theoretical and more application-oriented
